        <br>    
                I studied at City Central School in elementary. I studied at Iligan City National
                Highschool  in my junior highschool<br>days. Soon after, I went to Corpus Christi Parochial
                School of Iligan during my senior highschool days and graduated<br> with a humble award.

                As a student, I am not as intelligent as most people in MSU-IIT, but I am 
                determined enough to learn and acquire the <br>skills needed for my future career.
                In terms of music taste, I like western songs, western country music, japanese <br>pop music
                , and a little on the OPM. relationship status is 'not-single-anymore'.

        <br>    
                To be honest with myself, I am not aiming to graduate in MSU-IIT, although the school 
                made me a fine model on <br>what an ideal student should be, competent. Instead of having an
                ambition to graduate on my present college, I <br>vouch myself to go to a greater heights, 
                to study in an academy, preferrably Philippine Merchant Marine Academy <br>or (PMMA).
